computer visualisation in julia

- feed forward 
- convu;tional , 
- recurrent 

6 step : 
  collect 
  prepare the dataset and cleaning 
make the model 
train it 
and check accuracy 
export when goood 
 # certain transforamation to do ;
resize and covert color, and blacl. and white , cropping 
prepare the image data in machine learning, 
path = "training"
X = []
y = []
for label in readdir(path) # for open a file 
    for file in readdir("$path/$label") # opan a file again 
        img = load("$path/$label/$file") # load the image  
        data = reshape(Float32.(channelview(img)),28,28,1) # matrixed in file 
        if length(X) == 0
            X = data
        else
            X = cat(X,data,dims=3) # what doing cat
        end
        push!(y,parse(Float32,label))
    end
end



  # Flux.jl framework


in this article  , we start by playing with the image module in julia 
transform and image into an matrix 
#training the data , : just to measures the loss_function
in article their use the ADAM optimizer
verify the acquieracy
to make this way
we have to check  if the  model respond to ur need. or choose one that fit for us
- convolutional neural network

** hugging face for the base of sql in hugging face
L G

issue : 
 -i don;t know how to downlaod on kallgle or huggingface of mnsit for training 
- i don't know the sql command that allopw me to acces the data
